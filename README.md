"In traditional assessment methods, biases in grading can inadvertently affect students' academic trajectories. By harnessing the power of deep learning models, this study endeavors to create a more objective and equitable evaluation process, thereby fostering a fairer learning environment. Moreover, the timely feedback provided by these models can facilitate personalized learning experiences, enabling educators to tailor their support based on individual student needs. Additionally, the predictive capabilities of deep learning algorithms offer the potential to proactively identify students who may be struggling academically, allowing for early intervention and support. However, the adoption of such technology also raises ethical considerations, including issues surrounding data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and potential exacerbation of educational inequalities. Through rigorous examination, this research aims to navigate these complexities and pave the way for responsible integration of deep learning in education, ultimately enhancing student outcomes and promoting educational equity."
